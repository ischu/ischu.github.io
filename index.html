    <p> My name is Ian Schu. I am currently in a coding bootcamp at the University of Richmond in Virginia</p>
    <p> My dream is to become a great web developer, but I have a long way to go. 
        Currently I am struggling with CSS positioning and float. I am alway looking to learn new things.</p>
    <p> When I'm not coding, I'm working as a dog walker or spending time out with my friends. </p>
